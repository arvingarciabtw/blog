          As with any skill that you want to learn from the beginning, you have
          to start with the basics. The fundamentals. You need to have a good
          foundation.

          curriculum. At the beginning of the course, it was greatly emphasized
          that learning to code will be hard. I also know this because I've
          tried doing the curriculum before. The founder of The Odin Project
          wrote this amazing

          on why coding is so difficult. Apart from this, the difference of
          having a fixed mindset and a growth mindset was given great importance
          in this
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset"

        </p>
        <p>
          Before even diving into the basics of HTML, the basics of computers
          and how the web works were first taught. From my understanding, this
          is essentially what happens when you type an address into the browser
          and press <code>Enter</code>:
        </p>
        <p>
          The web browser will request the resource from the web server where
          the resource is stored. This is done via a network protocol called
          HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). If the request is successful, then
          the web server will send an HTTP response back the browser with the
          requested resource. In this process,
          <a
            href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >IP</a
          >
          essentially acts as the highway while
          <a
            href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/TCP-IP"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >TCP</a
          >
          acts as the transport mechanisms (like cars) that deliver your request
          to the destination (web server).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, after pressing <code>Enter</code>, your browser will ask
          your computer if it knows the IP address of this domain name. If it
          does, then it is simply translated to the IP address and the web
          server can send a response back. However, if your computer does not
          recognize the IP address associated with the domain, then your request
          goes to a
          <a
            href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >DNS server</a
          >
          and it is this server that will tell the browser what the IP address
          of the domain name is.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least, that's how I understood it anyway. I'm sure it is much more
          technical than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point, the basics of
          <a
            href="https://git-scm.com/doc"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Git</a
          >
          were also taught. Thankfully, I've already used Git in past personal
          projects and my previous internship. However, this was a good
          opportunity to practice
          <a
            href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Lazygit</a
          >
          for the week since I find this to be a very useful tool!
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, we now get to
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >HTML</a
          >! It was honestly quite nice having a refresher on HTML boilerplate
          code, especially on the <code>charset</code> attribute of the meta tag
          as well as the
          <code
            >name="viewport"
            content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"</code
          >
          to keep the site responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, this
          <a
            href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/links-and-images/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >resource</a
          >
          by Interneting is Hard is a fantastic read on links and images. It
          clearly taught me the difference of absolute, relative, and
          root-relative links. And most importantly, when I should use certain
          image types (jpg, png, svg, gif)!
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point on, everything I learned about HTML were put into
          practice in this
          <a
            href="https://recipes-seven-teal.vercel.app/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >project</a
          >, which is a simple recipes website. Take note, however, that there
          is styling on the website because this project was revisited once I
          went further along in the curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, I then had a refresher on CSS. Most notably, flexbox.
          Admittedly, I didn't fully understand <code>flex-grow</code>,
          <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code> before. But now,
          I understand it a lot more and can actually put
          <code>flex-grow</code> to good use now. Also, this
          <a
            href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          by Josh Comeau absolutely blew my mind on the capabilites of flexbox.
          I didn't think dynamic layouts were possible without the use of media
          queries, but I was astonished to see flexbox used so well!
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I made this
          <a
            href="https://landing-page-sigma-peach-49.vercel.app/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >project</a
          >
          which is just a simple layout that was followed in the lesson's
          instructions. I had a lot of fun personalizing it and making it
          Silksong-themed! Do take note that it is not responsive since
          responsiveness is not yet covered at this point of the curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now face the beast that is
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >JavaScript</a
          >. From here on out, I thought that I would struggle a bit in doing
          the projects. But surprisingly, it wasn't that bad. I have a strong
          feeling that it's because I took this
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >chapter</a
          >
          to heart, which talks about the importance of developing a problem
          solving framework (understanding the problem, planning, and
          pseudocode).
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back in the past, I would often just go straight to code
          without having a concrete plan in mind, so the application's structure
          ends up being a mess (and so I give up and delegate the debugging to
          AI, which makes it even more of a mess). This time around though,
          actually writing down first in plain English the flow of my
          application helps SO much when it comes to the actual coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, here are the projects I made for the JavaScript chapter.
          <a
            href="https://rock-paper-scissors-mu-kohl.vercel.app/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Rock paper scissors</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://etch-a-sketch-indol-xi.vercel.app/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >etch-a-sketch</a
          >, and a
          <a
            href="https://calculator-psi-black.vercel.app/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >calculator</a
          >. For each project, there definitely could have been more features,
          but I stuck with the defined scope in the respective lesson's
          instructions. The point of these projects is to practice JavaScript
          fundamentals anyways, so I didn't want to go over the top with
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will say this though, I am not yet super familiar with the built in
          string methods and array methods in JavaScript. Oftentimes, I had to
          keep going back to the documentation and see what method would work
          for my problem. Of course, re-reading documentation is perfectly
          normal, but I do want to reach a point where I'm at least comfortable
          with the most used methods out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          On another note, this
          <a
            href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-event-delegation/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          on event delegation is such a worthwhile read. Instead of adding an
          event listener to each element, you could just add that event listener
          to their parent and access the <code>target</code> property that
          references the element that dispatches the event. This is so useful,
          and so I used this concept for my JavaScript projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also almost forgot to mention, but I decided to integrate a little
          bit of AI into my learning journey. However, I specifically prompt it
          to never directly give me the solution. And instead, it should just
          keep asking me questions until I figure out a solution to the problem
          that I have. And honestly, it works a ton! I still have to think about
          the problem in hand, and I do end up learning a lot at the end of it
          all. But of course, I still pour in a considerable amount of time
          trying to figure out the problem by myself first before asking for
          guidance from AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any beginners like me out there, perhaps you could use the prompt
          that I use:
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic">
          "You are a senior developer. I am a beginner developer. I will ask you
          questions. However, do NOT directly give me the solution. Instead,
          like a good senior, you should ask me questions that will challenge my
          critical thinking to guide me in discovering or forming my own
          solution to the problem I asked. Is this clear?"
        </p>
        <p>
          That's about it for this week. Overall, it was very fun! Time to move
          on to the
