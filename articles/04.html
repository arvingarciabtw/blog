          This week, I went through some lessons covering computer science
          concepts (e.g. complexity, data structures, algorithms), intermediate
          Git, and test driven development with
          <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Jest</a

          as the testing framework.

          Up to this point I've been writing a lot of code, but of course it's
          also important to measure its efficiency. There's two ways to measure
          code efficiency: time complexity and space complexity. Essentially,
          time complexity is the amount of <em>time</em> an algorithm takes to
          complete while space complexity is the amount of memory (perhaps
          <em>space</em> is easier to remember) an algorithm uses during its
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won't go into detail regarding the notations, but this

          is pretty useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also won't go into detail regarding data structures and algorithms,
          but it is quite useful to know what data structure to use in certain
          situations. The CS chapter of the course was quite hefty, though if
          you'd like to see how I built certain data structures with JavaScript,
          you can view some of the

          Now, let's talk about Git commands. The basics were already taught
          early on in the curriculum, but Git was revisited and some other
          commands are introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the typical <code>git commit</code>, you can also do
          <code>git commit --amend</code>. This replaces our last commit with
          our new commit. It is important to remember though to
          <em>only</em> amend commits that have <em>not</em> been pushed
          anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The command <code>git rebase</code> integrates changes from one branch
          to another by moving commits to the latest point of the target branch.
          On the other hand, <code>squash</code> combines multiple commits into
          one. Then, we have <code>git reset</code> that moves your current
          branch to a different commit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I have to admit, I haven't used these commands in the projects
          that I've done. The trifecta of <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>,
          and <code>push</code> has served me well for my projects so far. But
          if I ever do goof up something, I can always refer to those other
          commands I've mentioned.
        </p>

          explores how to use Git in the real world. It essentially goes over
          the workflow of how you would use Git to collaborate with people, say
          for example contributing to The Odin Project. Put simply, this is what
          you'd do: fork the repository, clone that forked repository, make some
          changes, push, and open a pull request. I glossed over some details,
          but that's mainly how it goes.

          to contribute to resources that I actually use and benefit from, even
          if the contributions were quite menial.

          Test driven development (TDD) was given great importance in its
          chapter. The idea behind it is that you first write the tests, and
          then you write the code that is being tested. This
          <a
            href="https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/one-weird-trick-that-will-change-the-way-you-code-forever-javascript-tdd/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          by James Sinclair is a wonderful article that explains the value of
          doing TDD. A quote from the article:
        </p>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/one-weird-trick-that-will-change-the-way-you-code-forever-javascript-tdd/#notes-fn-1"
        >
          Test Driven Development is not about testing. It is a way of thinking
          and coding that just-so-happens to involve tests.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The article also mentions two simple rules in TDD that imply three
          simple steps, taken from a book by Kent Beck named Test-Driven
          Development by Example:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Write new code only if you first have a failing automated test.
          </li>
          <li>Eliminate duplication.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The three steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Red</b>—write a little test that doesn’t work, perhaps doesn’t
            even compile at first
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Green</b>—make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins
            necessary in the process
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Refactor</b>—eliminate all the duplication created in just
            getting the test to work
          </li>
        </ol>

          project was very useful. Following this kind of principle really
          reinforces you to start small, and it eventually helps you out in the
          long run. I'm excited to practice TDD more in future projects!
