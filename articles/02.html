        <p>
          Last week, I learned about the foundations of web development. This
          week, I explored some intermediate HTML and CSS concepts, as well as a
          touch of JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed the
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Intermediate HTML and CSS course</a
          >
          from The Odin Project curriculum, and also made some small progress in
          the JavaScript course. The course primarily covered intermediate HTML
          and CSS concepts, forms, and the CSS grid layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intermediate HTML concepts discussed were simple enough. There is
          a lesson each for Emmet, SVGs, and tables.
          <a
            href="https://docs.emmet.io/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Emmet</a
          >
          is basically a tool that allows you to write HTML a lot quicker by
          using syntax from CSS selectors. Perhaps the most useful (and arguably
          most used) Emmet feature is typing <code>!</code> and pressing
          <code>Enter</code>, which automatically generates HTML boilerplate for
          you. However, I do also add another <code>meta</code> tag with
          <code>name="description"</code> to add a description for my websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would absolutely love to use SVGs (animated SVGs in particular) more
          in the future, but I think I'm too early in my learning journey to be
          going down that rabbit hole. Here's an
          <a
            href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          by Josh Comeau that gives an introduction on SVGs, and the cool things
          he's done with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the intermediate CSS concepts, a ton was covered. Pretty much
          everything mentioned there was very useful. CSS units (<code
            >rem</code
          >
          is great!), resets (I use
          <a
            href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >this</a
          >
          one), text styles, additional properties not discussed from the
          Foundations course, advanced selectors, positioning (which I used to
          struggle with before), functions, custom properties, frameworks, and
          preprocessors. That's a lot!
        </p>
        <p>
          The concepts I've applied the most in my projects are using proper
          units, selectors, and custom properties. I now use
          <code>rem</code> instead of <code>px</code> for font sizes, margins,
          and paddings. Although, <code>px</code> still has its place for
          setting widths and heights on elements. Selectors like
          <code>></code> I use a lot more in my CSS now. As for custom
          properties, I use them for setting the color scheme of my project
          (e.g. <code>--c-red: #ff0000;</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          And while we're on the topic of units, this
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >video</a
          >
          by Kevin Powell on <code>rem</code> vs <code>em</code> is quite
          eye-opening. It is because of this video that I use
          <code>em</code> for buttons!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's talk about forms. On the surface, you'd think forms would
          be quite simple, but there is <em>so much</em> to read up on about
          forms. In MDN's
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms#introductory_guides"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >documentation on web forms</a
          >, there was so much information to unpack. And that's not even
          including
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >client-side form validation</a
          >! While I didn't expect forms to be quite a hefty chapter, it
          certainly taught me so much more than I knew before.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the forms chapter, I am now introduced to a new CSS layout:
          <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#aa-introduction-to-css-grid"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >grid</a
          >. While I still personally find the flexbox layout a bit more
          intuitive, I still understood the grid layout quite well and was able
          to accomplish the admin dashboard project without much trouble. I can
          definitely see its use for layouts like these. I am quite interested
          to know though how grid can be used once mobile responsiveness is
          considered. If you want to see the two projects I've made throughout
          this course, you may refer to this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-01-intermediate-html-and-css"

          >
          link.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's pretty much it for that course. I've already started the
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >JavaScript course</a
          >, but I don't want to go into the technical details of it just yet
          since this blog article is mainly for the stuff I learned from the
          intermediate HTML and CSS course. I've completed two projects in the
          JavaScript course so far,

          and

        <p>
          Overall, a week filled with a lot of learning. Next week will be all
          JavaScript!
