        <p>This week was filled with a <em>lot</em> of JavaScript.</p>

          Continuing on from where I left off last week, I moved on forward with

          course in The Odin Project curriculum. There's a lot of concepts to
          unpack so far: objects, object constructors, factory functions,
          classes, modules, package managers (<a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Webpack</a
          >), OOP principles, linting, and asynchronous JavaScript. That's a
          lot, so I'll do my best to go through my learnings for each of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple way to organize code is by using objects to group things.
          Typically, the best way to define objects is using the object literal
          syntax, which looks like this:
          <code>const anObject = { key: value };</code>. Then, when we want an
          object that will be duplicated, we can use an object constructor which
          is essentially just a function that has the first letter uppercased by
          convention. This concept was put into practice in my
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-02-javascript/08-library"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >library</a
          >
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, factory functions and the module pattern was explored.
          Previously, with an object constructor, you'd need to use the
          <code>new</code> keyword to create an object. But, with factory
          functions, you set up and <em>return the new object</em> when you
          invoke the function. My
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-02-javascript/09-tic-tac-toe"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >tic-tac-toe</a
          >
          project uses this concept. An example of a factory function:
        </p>
        <pre><code>function createPerson(name) {
  const username = "@" + name;
  return { name, username } // As you can see, we return an object
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          Typically, a factory function is used to make multiple objects. But,
          there are cases where you would want only <em>one instance</em> of it,
          and that is where an
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)</a
          >
          comes into play. This is also called the module pattern. A sample code
          snippet is provided below, taken from a
          <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >lesson</a
          >
          in The Odin Project.
        </p>
        <pre><code>const calculator = (function () {
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    const sub = (a, b) => a - b;
    const mul = (a, b) => a * b;
    const div = (a, b) => a / b;
    return { add, sub, mul, div };
    })();

    calculator.add(3,5); // 8
    calculator.sub(6,2); // 4
    calculator.mul(14,5534); // 77476
 }</code></pre>
        <p>
          But personally, I prefer classes much more than factory functions. You
          can create an object using the <code>class</code> keyword, which does
          the exact same thing as object constructors. I personally find classes
          to be much more readable and intuitive, and so I used classes in all
          of the projects moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, ES6 (or ECMAScript 2015) introduced something called
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >ES6 modules</a
          >. It allows you to modularize JavaScript code into modules and make
          them reusable across your application. Basically, you isolate some
          code into its own file, then you export whatever it is other files may
          need. Then, if other files would ever need that isolated code, these
          files can import it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there are a lot of third party code out there that can help us
          with our application. For example, in some of the projects I will
          mention later, a utility library named <code>date-fns</code> can be
          used to help you format your dates accordingly. To use these external
          libraries, we can import them through the use of a package manager
          like
          <a
            href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >npm</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, having a bunch of individual modules and imported third party
          files can reduce performance. Thankfully, bundlers like
          <a
            href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Webpack</a
          >
          helps in processing and optimizing our code in various ways. I'm still
          not entirely confident on how bundling really works, but the
          documentation explains the necessary stuff to bundle a simple web
          application. My
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-02-javascript/10-restaurant-page"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >restaurant page</a
          >
          project used Webpack as its bundler.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also worth noting that you can have separate configurations for
          the development and production environment of your application. The
          <a
            href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >documentation</a
          >
          for this helps greatly, and you can even use a utility called
          <code>webpack-merge</code> to make the configuration a lot cleaner. My
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-02-javascript/11-to-do-list"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >to-do list</a
          >
          project uses this configuration setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this point, it is important to know about good principles around
          the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm since I've been using
          objects and classes a lot. This
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9kocFX7R7BAe_CvvOCO_p9"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >video series</a
          >
          by Web Dev Simplified is a fantastic and concise resource covering the
          SOLID design principles. I'd say the code quality in my projects
          currently are far from perfect, but I do plan on working on improving
          it for each and every project I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another useful concept explored is linting. Admittedly, I didn't set
          up a linter and a formatter for the next project (which I'll get to
          later) because I use a Neovim distribution called
          <a
            href="https://www.lazyvim.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >LazyVim</a
          >
          that comes with a built-in linter and formatter on save. However, just
          to avoid confusion with other learners when I share my projects, I've
          decided to implement
          <a
            href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >ESLint</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://prettier.io/docs/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Prettier</a
          >
          configs for future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, let's talk about asynchronous functions in JavaScript.
          Basically, these are functions that happen in the background while the
          rest of the code executes. This is particularly useful for fetching
          data from a server to display on a site, just like what I did here in
          my
          <a
            href="https://github.com/arvingarciabtw/the-odin-project/tree/main/full-stack-javascript/fsj-02-javascript/12-weather-app"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >weather app</a
          >
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept that makes asynchronous JavaScript possible is the
          <code>Promise</code> object. This
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          from MDN web docs talks about the <code>Promise</code> object and its
          syntax. While you can use this syntax to do stuff like fetching data
          from a server, the use of the <code>async</code> and
          <code>await</code> keywords are much more readable and intuitive. This
          <a
            href="https://javascript.info/async-await"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >
          explains it pretty clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          On another note, I also want to talk a bit about AI use (not this
          again...). At the end of this
          <a
            href="https://blog.arvinagarcia.com/articles/01.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >article</a
          >, I mentioned how I used AI to guide me through discovering a
          solution to a problem. While this is fine, I've realized that it would
          be a lot better in the long run if I could form those questions myself
          anyways. If I can't figure out the right questions to ask myself on
          what is going wrong with my application, then clearly there is
          something I don't understand about the flow of my program. I need to
          have the skill of understanding the problem myself, without having to
          ask AI to guide me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when I do decide that I'm quite stuck, I should instead be asking
          for help from the community on Discord, instead of AI. Doing so would
          not just help me understand or solve my problem, but also build the
          skill of asking the right questions. It also fosters my skill of how
          to communicate properly with other developers, and how to take their
          advice to heart. It's a bit embarrassing saying all this now, because
          this was pretty much all said in the beginning of the curriculum. Well
          anyways, it's time to ban myself from using AI. For real this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's about it. Next week will be quite the challenge, since I'm
          expecting to be doing the battleship project. In the first time I was
          doing The Odin Project, this was where I stopped. I hope to overcome
          this hurdle this time around.
