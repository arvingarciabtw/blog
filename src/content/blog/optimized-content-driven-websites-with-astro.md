A week ago, I decided to refactor this blog because I wasn't really satisfied with the structure of my codebase, as well as with the site's performance. It was fine, but at least based from Lighthouse, performance could still go up a few notches.

I looked around to see what I could use to refactor this blog, and decided to go with Astro. And so far, I've been very happy with the switch! Let's talk about this framework.

From their site:

> Astro is a JavaScript web framework optimized for building fast, content-driven websites.

Sounds perfect for my use case!

Conveniently enough, it uses file-based routing, which is great for me because I just recently learned how to build web apps with Next.js. All of your pages go inside `src/pages`, and the name of the route segment will be based on the name of your `.astro` file.

To make an Astro component, create a file with a `.astro` extension. For instance, the footer component of this blog:

```astro
<!-- footer.astro -->
---
---
<footer>
  Made by
  <a href="" class="author" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    @arvingarciabtw
  </a>
</footer>
```

An Astro component can take in some props:

```astro
---
const { message } = Astro.props;
---
<p>{message}</p>
```

As you've probably noticed, there are these `---` code fences at the top. This top section is called frontmatter. Frontmatter in Astro is a metadata section at the top of Markdown, enclosed by `---`, written in YAML. It defines custom properties like title, description, and tags for content, which are accessible via Astro.props.frontmatter. You can also put JavaScript code inside of your frontmatter.

Perhaps my favorite feature though, are collections. This made it much easier to structure all of my blog posts, as compared to before I refactored. Essentially, `content/blog/` contains all of my posts.

I have this `[...slug].astro` file, which is a route to each of my post:

```astro
---
import { getCollection, render } from 'astro:content';
import BlogPost from '../layouts/blog-post.astro';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.id },
    props: post,
  }));
}

const post = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await render(post);
---

<BlogPost {...post.data}>
  <Content />
</BlogPost>
```

`Content` is the actual unique content of each post. In my `BlogPost`, that content gets put in the `<slot />` over here:

```astro
---
import BaseHead from '../components/base-head.astro';

const { title, description, pubDate, } = Astro.props;
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <BaseHead title={title} description={description} />
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <article>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p class="date">{pubDate.toString().slice(4, 10).toUpperCase()}</p>
        <div class="prose">
          <slot />
        </div>
      </article>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Seems a bit confusing to me at first because this is new syntax, but this is honestly much nicer than what I had before refactoring! For some context, I previously had a file that imported all of my posts one by one, and it did not look pleasant...

If you'd like to know the technical details about Astro's performance benefits, I'll instead point you to their docs instead of explaining it myself. The documentation will definitely explain it better than I can. Check out this [article](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/), as well as this overview on the [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).

All in all, Astro is great! I recommend this framework if you have a content-rich website, and you want to structure your content easily.
