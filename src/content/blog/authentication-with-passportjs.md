Continuing with the [Node.js course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs), this week I'll dive into authentication! Specifically, [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/), which is authentication middleware for Node.js.

Authentication is one of those topics that initially seemed quite intimidating to me. There's sessions, cookies, tokens, hashing, salting... it can get overwhelming pretty quickly. But, breaking it down into smaller concepts made it a lot more manageable.

From the [Passport.js documentation](https://www.passportjs.org/):

> "Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application."

Essentially, Passport.js provides a clean way to handle authentication in your Express applications. It supports over 500 authentication strategies, but the ones I've used are _local strategy_ (username and password) and _JWT strategy_ (JSON Web Tokens). I implemented both of these while doing my projects, so I'll go over how each of them works.

Before we dive into the strategies though, it's important to understand what authentication actually is. Put simply, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is. When you log in to a website with your username and password, you're being _authenticated_. After you're authenticated, the application needs a way to remember who you are as you navigate through different pages. This is where sessions and tokens come into play.

Now, let's talk about the local strategy first. This is the traditional username and password authentication that you've probably seen countless times. To get started, you'll need to install a few packages:

```bash
npm install passport passport-local express-session bcryptjs
```

The `passport` package is the core library, `passport-local` is the strategy we'll use, `express-session` handles sessions, and `bcryptjs` is for hashing passwords. You should _never_ store passwords in plain text!

Here's how you'd set up a basic local strategy:

```javascript
const passport = require("passport");
const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

// let's assume we have a User model from our database
const User = require("./models/user");

passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(async (username, password, done) => {
    try {
      const user = await User.findOne({ username: username });
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect username" });
      }

      const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
      if (!match) {
        return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect password" });
      }

      return done(null, user);
    } catch (err) {
      return done(err);
    }
  }),
);
```

Let's break down what's happening here. We're defining a new local strategy that Passport will use. The strategy takes three parameters: `username`, `password`, and `done`.

The `done` callback is what you call to signal whether authentication succeeded or failed. If the user is found and the password matches, we call `done(null, user)`. If there's an error, we call `done(err)`. If authentication fails, we call `done(null, false)` with an optional message.

Now, we also need to tell Passport how to serialize and deserialize users. Serialization is the process of converting the user object into a format that can be stored in the session, while deserialization is the reverse process. This is necessary because sessions store data as strings, not JavaScript objects.

```javascript
passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user.id);
});

passport.deserializeUser(async (id, done) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(id);
    done(null, user);
  } catch (err) {
    done(err);
  }
});
```

When a user logs in, `serializeUser` stores their ID in the session. Then, on subsequent requests, `deserializeUser` uses that ID to fetch the full user object from the database.

To actually use this in your Express app, you need to initialize the session middleware and Passport:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const passport = require("passport");

const app = express();

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your-secret-key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  }),
);
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
```

The order here is important! The session middleware must come before Passport's middleware. Also, never hardcode your secret key like I did in this example. Use environment variables instead!

Now, to handle login and registration, you'd create routes like this:

```javascript
app.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
    const user = new User({
      username: req.body.username,
      password: hashedPassword,
    });
    await user.save();
    res.redirect("/login");
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send("Error registering user");
  }
});

app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", {
    successRedirect: "/dashboard",
    failureRedirect: "/login",
  }),
);

app.post("/logout", (req, res) => {
  req.logout((err) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(err);
    }
    res.redirect("/");
  });
});
```

The `passport.authenticate('local')` middleware is what actually runs our authentication strategy. If authentication succeeds, the user is redirected to the dashboard. If it fails, they're sent back to the login page.

To protect routes that require authentication, you can create a simple middleware:

```javascript
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}

app.get("/dashboard", isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Welcome, ${req.user.username}!`);
});
```

The `req.isAuthenticated()` method is provided by Passport and returns `true` if the user is logged in. The `req.user` property contains the deserialized user object.

That's the gist of local authentication with Passport! Now, let's talk about JWT authentication, which works a bit differently.

JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is _stateless_, meaning the server doesn't store session data. Instead, when a user logs in, the server generates a token that contains the user's information, and this token is sent back to the client. The client then includes this token in the header of every subsequent request.

This approach is particularly useful for APIs, especially when building single page applications or mobile apps. It's also great for microservices architectures where you don't want to maintain session state across multiple servers.

First, you'll need to install some packages:

```bash
npm install passport passport-jwt jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

Here's how you'd set up the JWT strategy:

```javascript
const JwtStrategy = require("passport-jwt").Strategy;
const ExtractJwt = require("passport-jwt").ExtractJwt;

const options = {
  jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
  secretOrKey: "your-jwt-secret",
};

passport.use(
  new JwtStrategy(options, async (payload, done) => {
    try {
      const user = await User.findById(payload.sub);
      if (user) {
        return done(null, user);
      } else {
        return done(null, false);
      }
    } catch (err) {
      return done(err, false);
    }
  }),
);
```

The `jwtFromRequest` option tells Passport where to look for the token. In this case, we're expecting it in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The `secretOrKey` is used to verify that the token hasn't been tampered with.

The `payload` parameter contains the decoded token data. By convention, the user's ID is stored in the `sub` (subject) field.

Now, let's create login and registration routes for JWT:

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

app.post("/api/register", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
    const user = new User({
      username: req.body.username,
      password: hashedPassword,
    });
    await user.save();
    res.json({ message: "User registered successfully" });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Error registering user" });
  }
});

app.post("/api/login", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findOne({ username: req.body.username });
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid credentials" });
    }

    const match = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);
    if (!match) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid credentials" });
    }

    const token = jwt.sign({ sub: user.id }, "your-jwt-secret", {
      expiresIn: "1h",
    });

    res.json({ token: token });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Error logging in" });
  }
});
```

When the user logs in successfully, we generate a token using `jwt.sign()`. The first argument is the payload (the data we're encoding), the second is our secret key, and the third is an options object where we can set an expiration time.

The client would then store this token (typically in localStorage or a cookie) and include it in the Authorization header for protected requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

To protect routes with JWT authentication:

```javascript
app.get(
  "/api/profile",
  passport.authenticate("jwt", { session: false }),
  (req, res) => {
    res.json({ user: req.user });
  },
);
```

Notice we're passing `session: false` because JWT authentication is stateless. We don't want Passport to create a session.

So, when should you use local authentication versus JWT? Well, local authentication with sessions is great for traditional web applications where users are interacting with your site through a browser. It's simpler to implement and works well when all your authentication is handled by a single server.

JWT authentication, on the other hand, is better suited for APIs and single page applications. It's stateless, which means it scales better across multiple servers. It's also ideal when you need to authenticate requests from mobile apps or when you're building a microservices architecture.

One thing to keep in mind with JWT is that tokens can't be invalidated on the server side. So, if a token is compromised, it remains valid until it expires. This is why setting an appropriate expiration time is crucial.

I will say though, implementing authentication for the first time was quite challenging. There were moments where I wasn't entirely sure if I was doing things correctly, especially when it came to securely storing passwords and managing tokens. But, reading through the documentation and following along with examples really helped solidify my understanding.

This [documentation](https://www.passportjs.org/concepts/authentication/strategies/) from Passport.js is incredibly helpful for understanding how strategies work. Also, this [introduction to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) gives a great overview of how JSON Web Tokens work under the hood.

That's about it for this week! Authentication was definitely one of the more complex topics I've tackled so far, but it's also one of the most important ones to understand. Next week, I'll talk about [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), which I've been liking a lot!
