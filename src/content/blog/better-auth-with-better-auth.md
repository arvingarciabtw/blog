I've recently been learning Next.js by building a spaced repetition app. One of the features that it currently has, is authentication with Google and GitHub. For the authentication, I used Better Auth, and so far I found it much easier to use than NextAuth.

From their official website:

> The most comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript.

And Better Auth certainly is! It supports many popular frameworks, OAuth providers (like what I used, Google and GitHub), two factor authentication, and it even has a plugin ecosystem. To top it all off, it's super duper easy to use.

I'll only cover the simple stuff and what I've used in my own project. Though, here's a link to the [documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction) if you're interested.

You first just intall the package (with whatever package manager you want, in this case I use `pnpm`):

```bash
pnpm add better-auth
```

After installing, you add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET= # you can use openssl rand -base64 32 to generate
BETTER_AUTH_URL= # base url of your app
```

You then need an `auth.ts` file, which will have your auth instance:

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
  //...
});
```

To the file above, you need to configure your database. What you put in there varies based on what database or ORM you use. In my case, I used Prisma. After that, you can just configure whatever authentication methods you want:

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import prisma from "@/lib/prisma";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // Here I am using Prisma with postgresql
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "postgresql",
  }),
  // Since I only want Google and GitHub, I specify them as my social providers
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    },
    github: {
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    },
  },
});
```

After that's done, you then set up a route handler on your server. For Next.js app router, your `route.ts` would look like this:

```typescript
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"; // path to auth file
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);
```

Then lastly, create a client instance. For React, it would look like this:

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL, // environment variable that has your base URL
});
```

And that's it. It's that simple! Compared to NextAuth, I had a much easier time setting up auth with Better Auth. And like I mentioned before, you can do so much more with Better Auth. You have the option to implement two factor authentication, and it even has a plugin ecosystem.
