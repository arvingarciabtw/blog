      <p>I've decided to start over again with my learning journey.</p>

        I'm a bit ashamed to say this, but I've fallen down this{' '}

        rabbit hole for the past two years. About two years ago, AI emerged as
        this ultimate tool for productivity. I was a bit reluctant to try out
        this new technology, but most of my peers were using ChatGPT at this
        point so I decided to give it a try. It changed my life, and not in a
        good way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to now, I'm embarrassed to say that I absolutely do not
        understand the code that I write. If you asked me to clearly explain how
        my code works, I wouldn't be able to. If you asked me my thought process
        on why I structured my code the way it is, I'd simply say it's because
        it's what the AI spewed out. It's absolutely embarrassing to say the
        least.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's safe to say that somewhere along the line, I didn't actually learn
        some fundamental concepts that I needed to learn. And now, I'm paying
        the price. Sure, I'm able to prompt my way to a horribly-coded but
        surprisingly functional app. But at the end of the day, I didn't learn
        anything. And it's this feeling that has been bugging me for many months
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now, I want to go back to square one. This time, I will make it a
        rule for myself to never let AI directly give me code. I'm considering
        asking it about broader concepts, but for my own projects I want to be
        in front of the wheel. Of course, at some point, I should be integrating
        AI into my workflow a lot more. However, I strongly believe that it
        should only be done once I am confident in my own skills. If I integrate
        it into my workflow now, I feel that it will only hinder my learning,
        just like how it was for the past two years.

        curriculum. Once I am confident in building websites and web
        applications, I intend to learn creative web development on the side.
        Among the endless amounts of websites out there, the ones that use
        motion and 3d technologies always leave me speechless. So, I hope to
        someday be as good as the prominent creative devs in the sphere right
        now.

        Also, since I am starting over again, I decided that I might as well
        change my development environment. So, I decided to switch to Linux

        as my tiling window manager. As for the editor I will be using daily, I
        decided to go with{' '}

        . Since I want to primarily use my keyboard for pretty much everything
        now, I see a lot of value in switching from VS Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's pretty much it. Every week, I'll be writing a blog article
        talking about what I learned and what I did for that week.

      <p>It's time to lock in.</p>
